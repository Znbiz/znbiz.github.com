                    <p>
                        Before me stood next task: to develop an algorithm capable to draw graphs are on a rectangular grid. Drawing required such a manner that clusters be clearly visible. For a basis of offers to take the following algorithm <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/9/2036.full#F1">algorithm for automatic drawing of biochemical networks</a>. I has implemented his, the code can be viewed <a href=https://github.com/Znbiz/HelikarLab/tree/master/Grid%20layout%20algorithm/Variant%202>here the</a>. By of this algorithm had to eventually refuse because his operating speed on graphs with the number of vertices is greater than 10 exp fall. This happened due to the fact that in the algorithm is based on a complicated enumeration method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I suggested to move away from of this method and develop your own. My option was as search of a special number for each vertex, which would allow for one pass the vertices at a certain distance from each other. By this number was the number of of optimal ways extending through the top. Below are the pros and cons of this approach, and will show some examples of the algorithm.

                        Now the library <a href="https://github.com/helikarlab/ccNetViz">ccNetViz</a> draws signatures of vertices in one texture. This slows down the the rendering of the text with increasing the graph, and also makes it impossible to work with a variety of effects for text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To achieve the goal, it was decided to split task into several ones of subproblems.

What is the SDF can find out from the article <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf">Improved Alpha-Tested Magnification for Vector Textures and Special Effects</a>. The main thing this algorithm been to realize such a way that it worked on the client side.

                        SDF implements a simple algorithm in pure JavaScript to get the results which could not be incorporated into ccNetViz library. Since the processing time atlas containing 250 characters occupied a more than 10 seconds. After by me been a proposal to make all the calculations algortima using WebGL. The result of this decisions was the reduction in the processing time of the atlas 250 characters to a few tenths of a second ~ 0.6 seconds. The following is a working generator SDF.

                        I have suggestion that the quality atlas of drawing on the client side can be improved. In order to optimize and improvement of SDF algorithm WebGL take long, so as earlier no one this implemented the algorithm on WebGL. There are where to develop :)
